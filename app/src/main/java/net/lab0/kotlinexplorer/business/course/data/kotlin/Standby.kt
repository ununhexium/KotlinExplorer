`b` is the result on a previous computation.
You don't know for sure if it's true or false. It could be either.
In this specific example, it is `true`.

What is the type of `unknown`?

Here, `b` may either be `true` or `false`.

Even if in this specific case you see that `unknown` will be an `Int`,
it's not possible to know this in the general case.

Therefore `unknown` will have a type that is common to both `Int` and `String`.
This type is called `Any`.

Computers can only handle numbers, not characters.

Each characters is therefore represented by a number.

There are many different ways to do this translation but the most common is UTF-8.

Without going into details, UTF-8 assigns a number to each character. Here are a few:

```
${
        listOf('A', 'a', 'Z', '0', '\n', '\\').joinToString("\n") {
          "$it â†’ ${it.toInt()}"
        }
      }
```

When you write something like `print("A")`, this A is transformed
 into a `65` and that 65 is shows as "A" in pixels.
 This is of course greatly oversimplified but these are the essentials steps.
 
Kotlin has a way to express any arbitrary character using its codepoint.

This capability will be explored through the next pages.
