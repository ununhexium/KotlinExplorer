##### Naming

`n` is not a good variable name because you don't know what it is by looking at its name.

A better name would be `numberToTest`.
Unfortunately I have a very small character budget
if I want the code to fit on your phone.

##### Code style

The whole line `val n = 116` should be indented for readability.

##### Closing a block

`}` closes a block, not `]`.
